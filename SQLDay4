--Use Northwind database. All questions are based on assumptions described by the Database Diagram sent to you yesterday. When inserting, make up info if necessary. Write query for each step. Do not use IDE. BE CAREFUL WHEN DELETING DATA OR DROPPING TABLE.
--
--1.      Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
--
create view view_product_orderwei as
select p.ProductName, Count(o.Quantity) QuantityCount from Products p inner join
[Order Details] o
on o.ProductID = p.ProductID
group by p.ProductName;
--2.      Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accept product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.
--
alter proc spProductOrderQuant2
@id int,
@total int out
as
begin
select @id = view_product_quantity_order_wei.ProductID,@total =
view_product_quantity_order_wei.QuantityCount from
view_product_quantity_order_wei
where view_product_quantity_order_wei.ProductID = @id
end
declare @id int, @total int
exec spProductOrderQuant2 2, @total out
print @total
--3.      Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accept product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.
--
--4.      Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.
--
create table people_wei(id int,name char(20),cityid int)
create table city_wei(cityid int,city char(20))
insert into people_wei(id,name,cityid)values(1,'Aaron Rodgers',2)
insert into people_wei(id,name,cityid)values(2,'Russell Wilson',1)
insert into people_wei(id,name,cityid)values(3,'Jody Nelson',2)
insert into city_wei(cityid,city)values(1,'Settle')
insert into city_wei(cityid,city)values(2,'Green Bay')
create view Packers_wei as
select p.id, p.name from people_wei p inner join city_wei c on p.cityid=c.cityid
where c.city='Green bay'
begin tran
rollback
drop table people_wei
drop table city_wei
drop view Packers_wei
--5.       Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. (Make a screen shot) drop the table. Employee table should not be affected.
--
--6.      How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
the union two table, compare number of data of individual table with union table, if same, they have the same data.
